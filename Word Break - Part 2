Given a string s and a dictionary of words dict of length n, add spaces in s to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. Each dictionary word can be used more than once. Return all such possible sentences.

Follow examples for better understanding.

Example 1:

Input: s = "catsanddog", n = 5 
dict = {"cats", "cat", "and", "sand", "dog"}
Output: (cats and dog)(cat sand dog)
Explanation: All the words in the given 
sentences are present in the dictionary.

def wordBreak(s, wordDict):
    def backtrack(start, path):
        if start == len(s):
            sentences.append(" ".join(path))
            return

        for end in range(start + 1, len(s) + 1):
            word = s[start:end]
            if word in wordDict:
                backtrack(end, path + [word])

    sentences = []
    backtrack(0, [])
    return sentences

# Example usage:
s = "catsanddog"
wordDict = {"cats", "cat", "and", "sand", "dog"}
result = wordBreak(s, wordDict)
print(result)
